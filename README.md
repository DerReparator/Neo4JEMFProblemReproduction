# Neo4JEMFProblemReproduction

This repo contains a Gradle project illustrating the problem that I'm having with persisting a EMF model with NEO4J OGM.

A corresponding thread in Neo4J's forum can be found [here](https://community.neo4j.com/t/neo4j-ogm-mappingexception-field-with-primary-id-is-null-for-emf-class/50700).

## FIXED

The problem was fixed in a 3.2.29-SNAPSHOT version. This is mentioned in this [Comment](https://community.neo4j.com/t/neo4j-ogm-mappingexception-field-with-primary-id-is-null-for-emf-class/50700/4) in the Neo4J forum.
